**Mitype** is a program to test (and hence improve) your typing speed right from the ease of your terminal.

Written completely in python with no external dependencies!

## ✨ Main Features

- 🖥️ Cross-platform
- 🎦 See your replay
- 🐍 Supports Python 2 and 3
- 📝 Choose custom text input
- 🅰️ 6000️ text samples
- 🌈 Colored texts

## 🔧 Install

Mitype can be easily installed by:

```pip install mitype```

> If you are on windows, you'll also need [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/):

>```pip install windows-curses```

## 📈 Usage

Once installed, you can run it simply as:

```mitype```

You can also customize each run by specifying the following options as:

- ```-f FILENAME, --file FILENAME```  
  Uses contents of file as sample text.  
- ```-d N, --difficulty N```  
  N can be in range [1, 5] with 1 being the easiest. This decides the length of the text.  
- ```-i ID, --id ID```  
  ID can be in range [1, 6000].  

You can quit mitype anytime by pressing the `ESC` key or `CTRL-C`.
While in replay mode, you can quit by pressing `CTRL-C` only.

You can also directly [run on repl.it](https://mitype.mithil467.repl.run/) in your web browser although, the latency is pretty high.
